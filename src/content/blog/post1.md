title: "LSA-T: The First Continuous Argentinian Sign Language Dataset for Sign Language Translation"
description: >
  LSA-T is the first continuous Argentinian Sign Language (LSA) dataset. It contains ~22 hs of video extracted from the CN Sordos YouTube channel with Spanish subtitles, joints for each signer, and the inferred signer if there is more than one person in a clip. Videos are in 30 FPS full HD (1920x1080). We've also developed https://app.seni.ar, a platform for exploring, validating, and augmenting LSA-T.

## Abstract

Sign language translation (SLT) is an active field of study that encompasses human-computer interaction, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. Progress on this field could lead to higher levels of integration of deaf people. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first continuous Argentinian Sign Language (LSA) dataset. It contains 14,880 sentence level videos of LSA extracted from the CN Sordos YouTube channel with labels and keypoints annotations for each signer. We also present a method for inferring the active signer, a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the dataset, a visualization tool to explore the dataset and a neural SLT model to serve as baseline for future experiments.
